### Running The Example

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

# What Changed?

Now we'd like to cash in on pre-commit hooks. This will remove some of the complexity from our Dockerfile.

```dockerfile
# No multi-stage! We're back to a single stage build.
FROM python:3.11
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
    PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1 \
    PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the requirements.txt file
COPY ./requirements.txt ./

RUN pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
RUN pip install . --no-deps
CMD ["gunicorn", "pre_commit.main:app"]
```

## Changes from previous step

* We added a `pre-commit` hook to our project.
* We used a pre-commit hook to export a `requirements.txt` file from our `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files
  outside of
  our Dockerfile.
* We dropped the `poetry-export` stage from our Dockerfile.

### New Files

* [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](../.pre-commit-config.yaml) - The configuration file for pre-commit.

### Things that got better

* Our Dockerfile is almost back to its original simplicity.
* poetry.lock is the single source of truth for our dependencies with `requirements.txt` as a derived artifact.

### Things that got worse

* We added a dependency on `pre-commit` to our project.

# Summary

Now your Dockerfile is almost back to its original simplicity, but you still have a lot of flexibility in your
development environment. You can now add more pre-commit hooks to your project to make your life easier.

If you'd like to speed up your builds even more, you can jump
to [Extra 1 - Need for Speed](/extra-1-need-for-speed/README.md)

Alternatively, if you already read that, you can jump to the [final result](/README.md#final-result) of the series.
