# Step 1 - KISS Dockerized Python Image

## TL;DR

For the impatient, you can always skip to the take The Red Pill ðŸ’Š and skip to

### Running The Example

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

# A Starting Point

This is a simple Dockerfile for a Python project. We copy all of our application files into the image, install the
dependencies from a requirements.txt file, and run our server.

```dockerfile
# We start with the python3.11 base image.
FROM python:3.11

# Create the /app directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy all of our code into the /app directory
COPY . .

# Install our dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the production server
CMD ["gunicorn", "kiss.main:app"]

```

This will be our reference point for the rest of the examples, and we will incrementally improve it to a full-fledged
production-ready image.

## What's in this folder?

* [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) - The Dockerfile for the KISS image.
* [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) - Our project's dependencies in their most basic form.
* [`kiss/main.py`](./kiss/main.py) - Our project's entry point.
  A [FastAPI server](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/)
* [`.dockerignore`](./.dockerignore) - A file that tells Docker what to ignore when building the image.
* [`docker-compose.yml`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) - A file that tells Docker Compose how to run
  and build our image.
* [`gunicorn.conf.py`](./gunicorn.conf.py) - A configuration file for our production
  server executable, [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/).

# Summary

This the simplest Dockerfile you can write for a Python project. let's improve it
