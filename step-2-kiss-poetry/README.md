# Step 2 - KISS Dockerized Python Image with Poetry

## TL;DR

For the impatient, you can always skip to the take The Red Pill ðŸ’Š and skip to
the [final result](../README.md#final-result) of the series.

* [Step 1 - Keep it simple stupid](../step-1-kiss-requirements/README.md) - A simple Dockerfile
* [Step 2 - Keep it simple - with Poetry](../step-2-kiss-poetry/README.md) - A simple Dockerfile with Poetry
* [Step 3 - Basic Improvements](../step-3-basic-improvements/README.md) - A more robust Dockerfile, with a few
  improvements
* [Step 4 - Nontrivial Improvements](../step-4-nontrivial-improvements/README.md) - Advanced Dockerfile features

  compilation
* [Extra 2 - Need for Speed](../extra-2-need-for-speed/README.md) - Caching everything
* [Extra 3 - Moving Complexity](../extra-3-moving-complexity/README.md) - Moving complexity away from the Dockerfile
  into pre-commit hooks

### Running The Example

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

# What Changed?

We're all civilized people here, we're not going to use requirements.txt directly. We're going to use Poetry to manage
our dependencies. This will make our lives easier in the long run.


```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11

# Install poetry
RUN pip install poetry

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Install dependencies with Poetry
RUN poetry install --with prod

CMD ["poetry", "run", "gunicorn", "kiss.main:app"]
```

## Changes from previous step

* We added [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to our project.
* We're now managing our dependencies with poetry instead of a requirements.txt file.

### New Files

* [`pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml) - A file that tells poetry how to manage our project.
* [`poetry.lock`](./poetry.lock) - A lock file that tells poetry how to reproduce our project's dependencies.

### Things that got better

* poetry's lock file guarantees reproducibility across different machines.

### Things that got worse

* poetry is a new dependency that we have to manage.
* poetry will create a virtual environment for us, which means we have to activate it before we can run our project.
* This virtual environment also exists within our container.

# So Far

This is good enough to serve traffic, but there are a lot of wrong things here, let's fix these
in [Step 3](../step-3-basic-improvements/README.md)
