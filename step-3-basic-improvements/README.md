# What Changed?

There are some basic improvements we can make to the image we created in the previous step that will significantly
improve our experience with it.

## Changes from previous step

* We pinned the poetry version to the latest stable version (as of time of writing: 1.7.0).
* We split up the installation of the project dependencies and the installation of the project itself.

### No new files âœ¨

### Things that got better

* We're now protected from poetry being updated to a version that breaks our project.
* Splitting the dependency installation utilizes Docker's _layer_ caching mechanism. (our builds are now faster)

### Things that got worse

* More lines of code in our Dockerfile.
