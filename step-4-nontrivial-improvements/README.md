### Running The Example

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

# What Changed?

Now that we got the basics out of the way, let's make some nontrivial improvements to our image. These improvements will
make our image more robust, easier to debug and more friendly to container runtimes. Our final image is now more lean
and mean.

```dockerfile
# We're now using multi-stage builds!
# https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/
FROM python:3.11 as stage-1-poetry-export
RUN pip install poetry==1.7.0

WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency files
COPY poetry.lock pyproject.toml ./

# Generate a requirements.txt from our lock file
RUN poetry export \
    --with prod \
    --output requirements.txt \
    --format requirements.txt

FROM python:3.11 as stage-2-server

# Configure Python things to play nicely with the container host
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
    PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1 \
    PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the dependencies from the poetry-export stage
COPY --from=stage-1-poetry-export /app/requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the code
COPY . .

# Install the "root" package
RUN pip install . --no-deps

CMD ["gunicorn", "nontrivial.main:app"]
```

## Changes from previous step

* Drop poetry from the final image.
* We install the root pacakge with pip (instead of poetry).
* We use [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) to generate a `requirements.txt`
  from `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.
* We added some environment variables that ensure Python is playing nicely with Docker.
    * [PYTHONFAULTHANDLER](https://docs.python.org/3.11/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONFAULTHANDLER) - Python will dump
      the Python traceback if it receives a fatal signal.
    * [PYTHONUNBUFFERED](https://docs.python.org/3.11/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONUNBUFFERED) - Python will not
      buffer stdout and stderr (let the host handle it)
    * [PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE](https://docs.python.org/3.11/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE) - Python
      will not write `.pyc` files to disk.
    * [PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#environment-variables) - Pip will not
      check for new versions of itself. (Mainly cleans up the logs)

#### Explicitly Omitted Options

* [PYTHONOPTIMIZE](https://docs.python.org/3.11/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONOPTIMIZE) - Some packages rely on assert
  statements or docstrings to function properly. This environment variable will break those packages. (
  E.g. [Marvin AI](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/marvin))

### No new files âœ¨

### Things that got better

* Our builds are faster now (thanks to stage separation).
* We don't use poetry in our final image.
    * As a side effect, we no longer use a virtual environment inside our container.
* Python is now configured to in a way that is more friendly to container runtimes.

### Things that got worse

* **Even more** complexity in our Dockerfile. (To our defense, the complexity is mostly shifted to the poetry stage.)

# Summary

For small projects, this is more than enough. But as your project grows, you'll need to make some more changes to your
Dockerfile. Let's do that in [Step 5](/step-5-larger-project/README.md)
